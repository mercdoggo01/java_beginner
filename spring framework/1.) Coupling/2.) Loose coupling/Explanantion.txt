In the previous example, we have noticed how for each new object 
of different class many things had to be changed.

Now, to make application loosely coupled, we will implement an interface
Name TypeOfProjectile which will be implemented by both classes.

The interface will have the methods of both the classes. Therefore to use 
objects of both the classes one simply needs to comment one and the other will run.
