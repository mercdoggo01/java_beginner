The exception is normally an object that is thrown at runtime. 
Exception Handling is the process to handle the runtime errors.

In JSP, there are two ways to perform exception handling:

1.) By errorPage and isErrorPage attributes of page directive
2.) By <error-page> element in web.xml file

In the example used for this, a NUll string is taken and length of the string 
is taken using length() function resulting in NullPointerException error
