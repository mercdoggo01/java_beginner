Session Tracking is a way to maintain state (data) of an user.
Http protocol is a stateless so we need to maintain state using session tracking techniques. Each time user requests to the server, server treats the request as the new request. So we need to maintain the state of an user to recognize to particular user.

1. Cookies
2. Hidden Form field
3. URL Rewriting
